                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">Micro finance refers to a variety of financial services, such as loans, savings accounts, and insurance, that are offered to underprivileged company owners and entrepreneurs who lack collateral and would otherwise be ineligible for traditional bank loans. Microloans are typically granted to people in still-developing nations who engage in a range of vocations, such as carpentry, fishing, and transportation.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">India has a vast population and a booming economy. Both public and private sector banks are unable to establish branches in every community. Despite their expanded presence, Indian banks still still have a small geographic reach. Microfinance institutions (MFI) mostly work in remote areas and communities to support local small businesses and farmers.</p>
