            <h4>Types Of Company Registration In India</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Following the organisational structure must be one of the key factors in determining the type of tax
                or compliance. One of the most crucial choices a business owner can make today is deciding what
                kind of business registration is best for them. Additionally, our legal system supports a wide range of
                business types under different company registration formats. We will examine the various business
                registration options available in our country in this article.</p>

            <h4>Deep Analysis of Types of Company
                Registration</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The first and most crucial step in incorporating a business is registering a corporation. In India, there
                are many different kinds of businesses, so business owners must be careful to choose the right one
                for their operations. The Companies Act of 2013 established a number of regulations for the
                establishment of various types of businesses in our country. The various company types in India are
                highlighted in the section that follows.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h5>Public Limited Company</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">One whose stock is traded publicly is referred to as a public limited company. The number of shares
                that may be traded or sold in this type of corporation is unlimited. A public limited company&#39;s shares
                can be freely sold because they are listed on the Stock Exchange, making the shareholders the
                company&#39;s owners.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Such businesses must obtain a registration certificate from the ROC before starting their commercial
                operations. The public limited company must now comply with the requirements in order to register
                for this type of business.</p>


            <ul class="list-unstyled advantages-list">
                <li>The public limited company must be managed by a minimum of three directors.</li>
                <li>Indian descent is required for one of the three directors.</li>
                <li>There must be a minimum of seven shareholders for a publicly traded company.</li>
                <li>A capital fee of at least INR 5 Lakhs is also acceptable.</li>
                <li>It is necessary to have a registered business address in Indian territory.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h5>Private Limited Company</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Businesses that want to function like privately held companies should use private limited companies.
                In a privately held company, responsibility is shared among the shareholders rather than assigned to a single employee. This enables the members to safeguard their assets against any losses sustained
                by the business.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The total number of shares that each member owns makes up the total capital of a private limited
                company. The corporate and personal assets of the members are regarded as separate, improving
                safety and assurance. Shares of such a company are not available to the general public for sale or
                disclosure. It is currently one of the most popular ways to register a business in the nation. The
                following prerequisites for forming a privately held company were established by the 2013
                Companies Act:</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled advantages-list">
                <li>There could be as few as two directors and as many as fifteen in a private limited company.</li>
                <li>The directors must all have Indian ancestry at least.</li>
                <li>There can be as few as two shareholders and as many as 200 in a private limited company.</li>
                <li>A capital fee of at least INR 1 lakh is also acceptable.</li>
                <li>must have a company that is registered in the country.</li>

                <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify">In this sort of business, the member’s responsibility is unlimited, meaning it is not limited in any way.
                    This means that the member must pay for the loss with their assets in the event of a financial
                    catastrophe.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify">Another common method of company formation in India is partnerships. The Indian Partnership Act
                        of 1932 serves as the legal framework for these businesses. The partners in this business are in
                        charge of overseeing daily operations after the written agreement. The positions, responsibilities,
                        functions, and share count will now be listed in the partnership deed. If a partnership has a valid and
                        properly registered company partnership deed, it can operate without a licence. The partnership
                        firm must satisfy the following criteria in order to be eligible for this type of business:</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify">A new type of company registration in India is the Limited Liability Partnership, or LLP. It also has a
                        legal identity that helps distinguish between business and personal assets and shields the
                        entrepreneur from unlimited liability.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify">An LLP offers more protection than a sole proprietorship because the amount of share capital
                        determines the responsibility of each partner. Now, the LLP must comply with the following
                        conditions in order to obtain registration for such a company type:</p>

                    <ul class="list-unstyled advantages-list">
                        <li>A share capital requirement of at least one lakh is necessary.</li>

                        <li>To start this kind of business, you need at least two partners. The upper bound is uncapped.</li>
                        <li>If the remaining partners are corporations, there should be at least one individual partner.</li>
                        <li>The purchase of share capital is not subject to any restrictions.</li>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify">The one-person firm model is most advantageous to small businesses. This business form, which is a
                        part of the 2013 Companies Act, enables business owners who intend to operate their enterprises
                        solely on their own. The legal position of One Person Company gives it total control over its
                        operations, assets, and liabilities. The following conditions must all be met without exception by the
                        OPC in order for this type of company to be eligible for registration: -</p>
