                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">According to the 1938 Insurance Act, the Controller of Insurance governed the insurance industry in
                                        our nation up until 1999. However, the creation of the IRDA made people aware of the need for
                                        renewal in the insurance sector. This was due to the fact that the majority of the earlier provisions
                                        were no longer applicable or had become unnecessary.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">India has a vast population and a booming economy. Both public and private sector banks are unable to establish branches in every community. Despite their expanded presence, Indian banks still still have a small geographic reach. Microfinance institutions (MFI) mostly work in remote areas and communities to support local small businesses and farmers.</p>
