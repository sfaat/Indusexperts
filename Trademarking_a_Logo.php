                Logo in 2022</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 ">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Your logo design, which makes use of a logo mark, a typographic solution, or a combination of the
                two, serves as the most fundamental form of identification for your business. The most basic visual
                representations of your company are its logos. The logo for your company is very important because
                it communicates pride in the brand, its quality, and its core values. Your brand is represented by
                your logo design across all platforms, including your website, business cards, social media accounts,
                and even your products.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">Trademarking a Logo</h4>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                Trademarks protect intellectual property from theft and infringement. As a trademark, a company&#39;s
                name, description, logo, or other sign can be protected. The logo for your business needs to be
                protected because it took a lot of time and money to create.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Your brand is represented by your company&#39;s logo. Trademarking your logo is crucial to preserving
                its exclusivity because it is the main way that customers recognise your business. It would be
                extremely confusing and detrimental to your credibility if someone used your logo for another
                brand.
            </p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The trademark of a &quot;brand&quot; is frequently used in conversation. For instance, in addition to being
                brands, &quot;NIKE&quot; and &quot;COCA-COLA&quot; are also trademarks. Since the brand&#39;s owner &quot;trademarked&quot; the
                brand to obtain legal protection, they are also trademarks.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">As we&#39;ll discuss in more detail below, legal protection frequently prevents anyone other than the
                trademark owner from using the mark for comparable goods and services; in other cases, no one is
                allowed to use it at all.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The terms &quot;trademark&quot; and &quot;copyright&quot; are frequently confused, but a trademark protects a brand
                name, whereas copyright protects creative works like books, movies, and images.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Although it is frequently suggested, it is not always necessary to register your logo as a trademark.
                Even though a trademarked logo is not required for small, neighbourhood businesses, there are still
                a lot of benefits.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">In essence, there is no benefit to trademarking a logo, even though it may not always be necessary.
                Because infringement costs you a lot more and is something you can never plan for or anticipate.
            </p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">Importance of Trademark Registration</h4>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">A trademark registration for your logo has a number of advantages. Although it is
                not necessary, there are several benefits. Here are some advantages:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Priority</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">By registering your logo as a trademark, you gain exclusive rights to use it. You are only permitted to
                use a logo where you are actually located if it is not a registered trademark. This suggests that
                anyone, anywhere—even in the next town—can use a logo that is similar to or identical to yours.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Without trademark registration, you probably won&#39;t be able to stop it even if you created or used
                the logo first. If your logo is trademarked, you have legal options to stop other people from using it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Lawsuit</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">After trademarking your logo, you have the legal right to file a lawsuit against anyone who makes
                use of it without your knowledge or consent. In some cases, winning the legal battle requires only
                that the symbol be registered as a trademark.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">You also have the option of filing a criminal complaint against anyone misusing your trademarked
                logo.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Money</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If you need to sue someone for violating your logo trademark, having a trademark makes it possible
                to recover damages.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Import of Foreign Goods</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The import of foreign goods bearing a logo that might infringe on your trademark can be stopped if
                you have a registered logo trademark.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Foreign Trademark Registration</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">In India, you can register your logo as a trademark, and you can do the same thing elsewhere. This
                makes it possible for you to grow your business into foreign markets.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">How to online trademark a logo in four easy steps.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h6 class="p-1 m-0">Step 1: Accessibility of your logo</h6>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Before moving forward, you must make sure the logo you have created qualifies for trademark
                registration.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">To be registered, your logo must be unique. Since they might resemble other logos, stay away from
                using cliched or widely-used images.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h6 class="p-1 m-0">Step 2: Get Ownership Of Your Logo</h6>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">There are numerous ways to obtain the rights to your company&#39;s logo, but they all demand varying
                degrees of dedication. Start using your logo right away to start acquiring rights as quickly and
                affordably as you can. However, this is extremely dangerous because it does not stop people in
                other areas from taking it.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">You can submit an application to register your company&#39;s logo as a trademark with the secretary of
                state in the state where your company is based. This protects your legal rights there and stops
                organisations from other countries from stealing your logo.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">A trademark application is processed over time after filing.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h6 class="p-1 m-0">Step 3: Secure The Trademark</h6>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">You have the legal right to use your trademark across the nation and to take legal action if it is
                violated if it is officially registered with the USPTO.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">You have the authority to forbid the importation of goods from abroad that bear your logo thanks to
                your logo trademark.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">It is impossible to overstate the significance of this advantage for companies and industries fighting
                the proliferation of goods with counterfeit brand logos. For example, fashion brands or tech
                companies could stop people from copying their products.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h6 class="p-1 m-0">Step 4: Monitor Your Trademarked Logo</h6>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If you think that successfully registering a trademark signifies the end of your efforts, reconsider.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Your company must keep a close eye on trademark usage to protect your logo and make sure no one
                else is using it. Lawyers with specialised training can handle this type of demanding, ongoing work.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">They need to be on the lookout for anyone using or trying to trademark a logo that is similar to
                yours. In the event of infringement, the attorney sends a stop and desist letter.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">What to Consider When Registering a Logo</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                A trademark cannot grant you exclusive rights to any generic goods or services. Yellow Mangoes is
                too straightforward and generic to be protected under copyright as a company name.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">A trademark cannot bar third parties from using your intellectual property in a way that is permitted
                by the Fair Use Doctrine. The general public is allowed to make fair use of works that are
                copyrighted and trademarked in a way that avoids consumer confusion.
            </p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Only the country in which you registered your trademark will offer protection for your logo. After
                you have already done so, it is simpler to register your logo in another country. However, you must
                still register a distinctive trademark there if you want legal protection in every country.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If your logo is strong enough, it will be eligible for trademark protection. If it isn&#39;t high-quality and
                distinctive, trademark agencies will reject it.
            </p>

        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">Defending your copyright and trademark rights</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                After registering your trademark and copyright, it is your duty to protect your name or logo from
                unauthorised use by anyone else by enforcing your trademark and copyright rights.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                Although the United States Patent and Trademark Office will ensure that no one registers a mark
                that is the same as yours or appears to be an exact replica of it, you are still in charge of defending
                the rights to the intellectual property of your company in the event that someone attempts to use it.
            </p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                You have two options when taking legal action to protect your trademark from infringement. You
                can either file a lawsuit for trademark infringement or send a cease-and-desist letter.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                There are businesses that can help you set up a &quot;trademark watch&quot; to make sure no one else tries to
                use the mark of your company. You could also hire a lawyer to watch out for trademark violations so
                they can advise you on the best course of action to take in order to obtain the protection you need.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">To help them through the entire copyright and trademark process, many people decide to work with
                an attorney. However, having one is not only optional but also unnecessary because you are capable
                of completing everything on your own.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The trademark application filing process will undoubtedly be aided by us, but if you ever need to use
                a trademark, it may be advantageous to hire a separate trademark lawyer.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">While we will undoubtedly support you throughout the trademark application filing process, there
                may be benefits to working with your own trademark lawyer should you ever need legal advice.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Only if you decide to hire a private trademark counsel before submitting your application will we
                contact them throughout the entire trademark registration process.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">In addition, a private trademark attorney can advise you on how to defend your rights in the event
                of trademark infringement and what to do if someone claims you&#39;ve stolen their company&#39;s logo.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">How the approval of trademarks is carried out</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                We won&#39;t check their trademark database until after you&#39;ve already submitted your application to
                see if the mark you want to register is still open for business.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                When the outcomes are prepared, they will notify you. If they find a mark that is identical to or very
                similar to the one you are trying to register as a trademark, they will reject your registration and you
                won&#39;t get a refund.
            </p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                Regardless of the application format you choose, you must include the following information:
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                A representation of the trademark in its exact form, as it appears in commerce, in colour (if
                appropriate).
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The full name, postal address, and email address of the trademark owner.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Placing a charge.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The company or product that the trademark designates, as well as proof that the trademark is being
                used commercially.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The owner&#39;s signature.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If the examining attorney determines that your application satisfies the requirements for approval,
                they will authorise your mark for publication in the &quot;Official Gazette,&quot; a weekly publication of the
                United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">After the trademark registration of your mark is published, anyone who thinks they might have been
                harmed by it has 30 days to file an opposition to the trademark registration or a request for an
                extension of the opposition period.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If the opposition is unsuccessful for the party who filed it or if none at all, the Trademark Office will
                accept your trademark registration and issue you a certificate of registration. Maintaining your
                trademark registration is crucial because you must notify the Brand Office when your trademark is
                being used.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">After your trademark registration has been approved, you must submit specific maintenance
                documentation. If you don&#39;t do this, your trademark will lose its validity or be revoked. In order to
                confirm that your trademark is still in use, it must also be verified between the fifth and sixth years
                of trademark registration and between the ninth and tenth years of trademark registration.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">Conclusion</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                While copyright and trademarks may both safeguard your intellectual property, they do so in various
                ways because they protect different kinds of assets in different ways. A copyright protects written
                and creative works, while a trademark focuses more on securing elements that define and identify a
                company&#39;s identity, like a logo.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                More than just money is included in your company&#39;s assets. They also include intellectual property,
                which you must protect in order to stop unauthorised use by others. Intellectual property has the
                potential to increase the value of your company.
            </p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                Copyright and trademarks offer that kind of protection, so registering your logo is necessary to
                protect your brand.
