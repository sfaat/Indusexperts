            <h4>NBFC Compliance</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to acquiring stocks, shares, and other marketable securities issued by a government or
                local authority, NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) also collect deposits, loans, and advances.
                The Companies Act of 2013 governs the incorporation of these companies. NBFCs carry out lending
                operations on a par with banks, but they are not banks. NBFCs must comply with specific
                requirements and submit returns on a regular basis, just like banks are required to do. If you don&#39;t,
                you risk receiving severe fines or even having your NBFC Registration Certificate revoked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Recently, NBFC compliance has grown more difficult. Before the RBI established new NBFC
                Compliance guidelines, banks benefited from non-banking financial firms, and compliance with them
                was easier and more permissive. NBFCs are required to submit various returns to the RBI regarding
                their acceptance of deposits, ALM, compliance with prudential norms, and other matters in
                accordance with the Master Direction, NBFC Returns (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016. The
                cornerstone of secure and RBI-compliant NBFC operations is the master directives. NBFC
                compliances and returns are intricate, so you should carefully review them to prevent paying hefty
                fines.

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The RBI has moved the supervisory return online filing process from the COSMOS platform to the
                XBRL system. As a result, NBFCs need the following in order to submit returns on the new XBRL
                platform:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Obtain the User ID and Password for the Reserve Bank of India; an XBRL RBI file needs to be
                installed.</p>

            <p>The RBI will impose severe penalties on you if you are an NBFC and fail to comply with the rules on
                time. The consequences for noncompliance change depending on the type of NBFC. The confiscation
                of the NBFC licence or perhaps the company&#39;s dissolution would be among the most serious
                consequences.</p>
