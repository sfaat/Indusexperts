                                        Refers to the transfer of shares by operation of law. This means that after the death of the original shareholder, the shares will pass to the legal heirs. Death, bankruptcy, marriage, insanity, inheritance,

                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">bankruptcy, or other "legal" causes other than natural transfer may create complications for the transferee in transferring shares. Not only are you a shareholder, but you are also the owner of all rights after registering with the stock transfer company. If you don't seek professional help, you may suffer a great loss. At MUDS, we are here to help our valued clients with various stock transfer issues. Let's take a look at some of the issues that can arise during the stock transfer process.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">'Share Transfer' and 'Share Transfer' are interchangeable terms:
                                        This has proven to be one of the most typical problems faced by shareholders. Indian Company Law emphasizes the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of shares”. A "transfer of shares" is entirely dependent on the actions and choices of shareholders, whereas a "transfer of shares" is entirely dependent on the application of law. Shares are inherited or transferred by testament only in the case of a "transfer of shares", which is usually not carried out with special care.</p>
