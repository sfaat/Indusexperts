        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 ">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In India, the food industry is supervised and governed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of
                India, or FSSAI. By ensuring that food products are subjected to quality inspections, this stops
                violations of food laws and the sale of inferior goods. An FSSAI registration or licence is legally
                required for anyone operating a food business who is involved in the production, processing, sale, or
                distribution of food products.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">Benefits of FSSAI Registration</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>Customer Base Improvement:</b> Consumers are significantly more aware of the food they consume in
                this age of digital transformation and instant connection. They choose to consume wholesome,
                unadulterated food that hasn&#39;t been altered or compromised in any way. The quality of the food
                that consumers eat is now taken seriously. The concept of an FSSAI licence is familiar to today&#39;s
                client. Therefore, they look for the FSSAI mark before making any food purchases. If you have
                registered with the organisation, you are allowed to place an FSSAI logo on your products.
                Customers will consequently be sure to purchase your goods.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Statuary Advantages:</b> Because obtaining a food license is a time-consuming, expensive, and
                exhausting process, many business owners prefer to avoid it. Companies, however, are ultimately
                unable to avoid it because they need the licence in order to function. To protect themselves from
                potential legal trouble, they should request an FSSAI accreditation. The procedure is also not overly
                expensive or challenging. By abiding by FSSAI laws, you can successfully run your business while also
                experiencing intense personal satisfaction.
            </p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Business Image: Every business unit aims to achieve a dominant market position that will bring long-
                term benefits. One strategy for opening this place is to obtain the food licence. If you have a food
                licence but your rival does not, you will benefit from a stronger market position. To enhance your
                reputation as an honourable restaurant, you should prominently display your licence on your
                property.

                India?</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The primary objective of FSSAI is to promote public health through food licencing. It assists in
                controlling and avoiding any conceivable food-related issues. Depending on the type of food
                company and its size, food business owners (FBOs) may apply for one of the three categories of food
                licences issued by the FSSAI.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Under the FSSAI&#39;s Central License Program, food businesses like large-scale producers, importers,
                etc. frequently qualify for this licence. In this case, the licence is granted based on the data that the
                head office has on file with the FSSAI. The business must conduct business in multiple states in order
                to be eligible for this licence. The duration of this licence is one to five years.</p>

            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Documents Required for FSSAI Registration?</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;"><b>The following documents are needed for the FSSAI registration process:</b></p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">You will be required to submit a completed form that has been certified and signed by the owner of
                the restaurant or the owner.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Identification documents like an Aadhaar card, a driver&#39;s licence, a voter ID card, etc. must be
                presented by you as the owner.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">a restaurant&#39;s or other establishment&#39;s official address documentation.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">A working email address and a phone number must be provided by the applicant. The company must
                provide both a phone number and an email address if it is new or has both.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Obtaining and attaching a food safety management plan form is required. If not, the FBO can obtain
                one by contacting the local notary public or printing the necessary documents online.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The proof that you own the business location should be included with the other documents. Initially,
                the proof of the business location could be shown by displaying a sales document, a lease
                agreement, power bills, or other similar documents.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Either a NOC issued by the regional corporation or another local body, or the national occupational
                classification, must be submitted.</p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If the kitchen is lavish and recently renovated, a floor plan might be shown. Little kitchens and tiny
                businesses are not covered by it. If there are numerous business partners running the food stand or
                company, the partnership deed should be displayed.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">There&#39;s a chance that not all of the documentation for the different food businesses will be simple to
                find. For smaller businesses, some of the aforementioned documents are not necessary. For the
                FSSAI certificate registration, you must, however, provide all the documentation you are able to. The
                applicant can register online with the FSSAI in order to obtain the certificate. It is very easy to
                complete the FSSAI online registration process with the help of a legal expert.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The verification process will start after the FSSAI food licence registration process is finished. If you
                satisfy all requirements, the authority will grant you an FSSAI certificate.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The food authority will once more request licencing fees if the renewal of the current licence is still
                pending after the predetermined amount of time. A gap is considered between the dates of
                expiration and renewal. The owners of the businesses must apply for a new licence if they want to
                keep conducting business under FSSAI registration. The registration is still regarded as being valid 30
                days after the license&#39;s expiration date pending FSSAI renewal confirmation. A FSSAI online
                application for renewal is also made available on the FSSAI website.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Everyone who has registered with the FSSAI is required to abide by the rules and regulations of the
                Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006. The food safety officer frequently uses a checklist to
                examine the operator&#39;s facility and assess the level of compliance with the regulations. In
                accordance with the level of compliance, the food safety officer describes it as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Compliance (C)</li>
                <li>Non-compliance (NC)</li>
                <li>Partial compliance (PC)</li>
                <li>Not applicable</li>


            </ul>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">If required by Section 32 of the FSS Act, 2006, the Food Safety Officer may issue a notice of
                improvement based on the information presented above. If the business owner disregards the
                notice for improvement, the licence may be revoked by the officer after the licensee has had a
                chance to explain. The state&#39;s food safety commissioner will hear appeals from any owner of a food
                business who has been specifically impacted by this notice of improvement. The High Court of
                Justice or the Food Safety Appeals Tribunal may even be used to appeal the decision.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The registration and renewal processes are both closely monitored by the FSSAI regulators.
                Therefore, the authorities will promptly notify FBOs who violate the FSSAI registration process and
                take appropriate action.</p>
