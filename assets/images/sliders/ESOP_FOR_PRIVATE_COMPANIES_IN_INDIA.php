            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Employee stock option plans (ESOP) or employee stock option schemes can assist in creating a
                skilled workforce, which is necessary for business success in the modern world (ESOS). Due to the
                vibrant ESOP startup culture in India, employee stock options have recently gained in popularity
                there. Today&#39;s high performers expect more from their employers than just a salary, and esop
                startups have benefited from this change in demands to attract and retain top talent. The
                fundamentals of employee stock options in a private limited company are examined in this essay.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">This tactic has helped ESOP behemoths like Amazon, TCS, Apple, and others produce millionaire
                employees.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Infosys, a significant multinational corporation, reportedly awarded its employees more than 5
                billion shares as compensation in 2019. It has been noted as the first company to grant access to
                such a large sum to its employees.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">An employee&#39;s right to buy company shares at a set price is known as an ESOP. The employee stock
                ownership plan (ESOP) of a private company can be viewed as a positive incentive for employees to
                participate actively in the company. Most private companies that are not publicly traded or new,
                inexperienced companies with limited resources offer it. They receive compensation in the form of
                bonuses or pay plans.</p>

                The abbreviation ESOP stands for Employee Stock Ownership Plan, also known as Employee Stock
                Option Plan. It is a popular strategy used by both publicly traded companies and privately held
                businesses to motivate employees. The business continues to employ this tactic frequently in order
                to hire, inspire, and meet the needs of its employees. The dynamics of the Indian economy have
                changed as a result of ESOP. Since they are unable to pay their employees well but are willing to sell
                them future company shares as a substitute, startups typically support ESOPs. In exchange for
                benefits like ESOP, the company demands long-term commitment from its employees.

                Employee stock option plans (ESOPs) allow employees of a business to purchase company shares at
                pre-determined prices. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) give employees the option—but
                not the obligation—to purchase a set number of shares for a set price over a set period of years.

            <h4 class="p-1 m-0" style="font-weight: bold;">The following three considerations should be kept in mind when
                creating ESOP plans:</h4>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 ">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) give employees the choice or right to buy company shares
                at a predetermined price. As a result, if the share price is less than the option exercise price, the
                employee is not required to exercise the right to buy company shares. It is not required.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The ESOP exercise price is the predetermined price at which an employee may later purchase
                company shares.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">ESOPs have vesting periods and vesting percentages. how long an employee must be employed by
                the company for during the vesting period in order to be qualified for the ESOP.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The excise period is the time period that an employee has to exercise an option granted by an ESOP.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) reward staff when stock prices increase, motivating both
                shareholders and staff to work toward a common goal. Offering ESOPs remains a great strategy for
                companies looking to build teams of high achievers. Employers who offer ESOPs to their staff
                members aim to align employee interests with those of the company&#39;s shareholders. To increase the
                value of their shares, shareholders work to improve the company&#39;s financial and operational
                performance.</p>

            <h4 class="p-1 m-0" style="font-weight: bold;">Why Do You Employe ESOP in Private Limited Company</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <p class="p-1 m-0" style="font-weight: bold;">The following rules must be followed in order to donate an ESOP to an Indian Private Limited
                Company:</p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">a director of the business who is not an independent director; a full-time or part-time permanent
                employee of the company who has worked in India or elsewhere; or
                a worker for the corporation, a holding company, an affiliate business, or a worker abroad or in
                India.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                Employees who are promoters, members of the promoter group, or directors who directly or
                indirectly own more than 10% of the company&#39;s outstanding equity shares—either personally or
                through their families or other bodies corporate—are not eligible for an ESOP.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The ESOP plan must be approved by the company&#39;s shareholders after they pass a special resolution
                with justification.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The company issuing the ESOP will decide what the exercise price will be.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;"> class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;"There must be at least a year between the option&#39;s award and its vesting.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Employees may not assign or otherwise transfer their Options.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The specifics of the ESOP plan must be disclosed by the Board of Directors in the Director&#39;s Report
                each year.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">An ESOP Register and records of the options granted to employees must be maintained by the
                business.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">In addition to the requirements above, the corporation is also required by Rule 12(10) of the Rules to
                follow the following guidelines:</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">(a) Use Form No. SH.6 to keep a register of all employee stock options granted under Section
                62(1)(b) of the Act.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">(b) The Register of Employee Stock Options shall be kept at the registered office of the Company or
                such other place as the Board of Directors may from time to time specify.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">(c) The entries in the register must be certified by the company secretary or any other person the
                board of directors designates.</p>

                Please motivate them to contribute to the company&#39;s growth and success.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">In 1956, section 2 of the Companies Act first mentioned the ESOP plan. This
                strategy was put into operation by the Companies Act of 2013, which
                established some guidelines that must be followed. According to Rule 12 of
                the Rules, 2014, the procedures for providing ESOP to workers are as follows:</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                It may be given to a permanent employee of the business who resides in or outside of India.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">He should be the organization&#39;s long-term director.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">He should serve as a permanent director or employee for an Indian subsidiary company.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Although it isn&#39;t stated explicitly, employees who have been with the company for a significant
                amount of time are regarded as permanent employees. It cannot be given to a director who may
                own 10% of the company&#39;s equity shares or to an employee who is a member of multiple promoter
                groups.

            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Working on ESOP for Private Companies:</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;"><b>The ESOP system usually depends on two factors:</b></p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The day the company announces that employees may purchase shares is known as the vesting
                period. It is not bound by any obligations or laws. It might take a while. After the vesting period,
                employees who take part in the ESOP plan can purchase shares at a significant discount from their
                market value.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The employee purchases or transfers the business share during the exercise period. As of right now,
                the employees have received their share.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                An ESPS for a listed company is an ESOP (Employee Stock Purchase Scheme). It is explained as a
                strategy in which employees receive company shares as part of a public offering.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Difference Between ESOP and ESPS:</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">ESOP is for privately held businesses that are not publicly traded, whereas ESPS is for privately held
                businesses that are publicly traded. The ESOP does not impose duties while issuing shares to its
                employees at a fixed price, in contrast to the ESPS, where employees do not have rights to ESOP
                shares but can purchase them at a discounted price. They deduct money from their ESPS
                compensation.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">ESOP Benefits for Private Companies:</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The employees are motivated when their efforts are acknowledged.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The business benefits from keeping loyal employees on a long-term basis.</p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">As has been demonstrated, using the ESOP can reduce taxes.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Once the employee retires, it provides a pension.</p>


            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s supplemental capital is raised.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">It halts the flow of money out of the system.</p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">It works out of the same business unit as the workers do.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">Like a coin with two sides, everything has a positive and negative side. Although we have only
                discussed the advantages of ESOPs for employees up to this point, there are inescapable

                disadvantages. The ESOP also has a drawback. Businesses that don&#39;t generate enough revenue fail to
                reward their employees and may even lower their pay.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 py-1 my-1">
            <h5 class="p-1 m-0">Disadvantages of ESOP for private companies:</h5>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s liquidity may be impacted if ESOP becomes necessary after a certain amount of time
                has passed.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">In some businesses, the ESOP may sporadically become taxable when an employee exercises the
                value of his ESOP share. If he makes money off the sale of the shares, it also becomes taxable.</p>

        </div>

            <h4 class="p-1 m-0">Conclusion</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">
                Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) at private companies have been successful in fostering a
                sense of employee ownership among staff members and luring new hires as the company grows.
                The ESOP should be used to motivate the workforce by honouring their dedication to the company.
                It motivates staff to contribute to the company&#39;s success. Promoting an understanding of the ESOP
                plan, its rules, and its numerous business financial processes requires a highly qualified and
                knowledgeable individual. The ESOP system will significantly improve the economies of India and
                other countries after a few years.
