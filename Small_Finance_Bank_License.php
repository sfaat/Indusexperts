                                        Small Finance Banks are registered as public limited companies under the Companies Act of 2013, are granted licences under section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, and are principally controlled by the RBI Act of 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act of 1949. Small Finance Banks were established with the intention of serving rural and semi-urban regions, including unorganised areas, small companies, etc. They get income by obtaining deposits from people who have current and savings accounts, make fixed deposits, etc. The RBI must provide its clearance before any small financing bank may launch a new branch. It should expand 75% of its ANBC to the PSL-designated classified sectors.

Many people who had previously been able to obtain a personal loan or borrow against the value of their houses have discovered that they are no longer eligible for these loans. Payday loans are short-term, no-collateral loans with sums often ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. They are designed to be returned in full within a relatively short amount of time (two weeks). These loans are offered by lenders to customers who have an urgent financial need that cannot wait until their next paycheck.</p>
