Microloans are typically granted to people in still-developing nations who engage in a range of vocations, such as carpentry, fishing, and transportation.</p> -->

                                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">Since its abolition, RBI has emphasized the use of cashless transfers for all monetary purposes. A prepaid wallet is a financial tool that helps transfer or carry money in digital form. RBI is responsible for issuing licenses for prepaid wallets. Many existing and new businesses are constantly applying for prepaid wallet licenses. A prepaid wallet license is a prepaid payment instrument that facilitates the purchase of goods and services, including wire transfers, for the value stored in such instrument. The value stored in such goods represents the value paid by the holder.</p>

                                        Prepaid wallets and digital wallets have different uses.
                                        When using a digital wallet, your money stays in your credit card or bank account.
                                        In a prepaid wallet, depending on the kind of wallet you use, money transfers from your account to
                                        either a merchant&#39;s current account or an escrow account.

                                                To ensure the applicants&#39; eligibility at least on the surface, the applications must first be
                                                screened by RBI.
                                                STEP 4: <br>
                                                The Reserve Bank of India grants a &quot;in-principle&quot; approval if the requirements are met and
                                                other conditions are satisfied. Six months after the date the RBI issued the in-principle approval, it
                                                will no longer be valid.
                                                Within these six months, the entity must provide RBI with a satisfactory System Audit Report; if not,
                                                the in-principle approval will automatically expire. In advance and with valid documentation, an
                                                entity may request a one-time extension of six months in writing.
                                                Step 5 :<br>
                                                If the entity does not provide RBI with a satisfactory System Audit Report within these six
                                                months, the in-principle approval will automatically expire. An entity may request a once-only
                                                extension of six months in writing in advance with good cause. The RBI retains the right to reject this
                                                extension request.

                                                Step 6: <br>
                                                Following consideration of all information provided by entities, final authorization is granted.
                                                If business is not started within six months of the certificate of authorization being granted, the
                                                authorization will automatically expire.

                                                STEP 7: <br>
                                                Unless otherwise stated, the Certificate of Authorization is valid for five years and is subject
