That is why we place a premium on high-quality standards for safe and secure transactions, as well as customer data privacy. Please read the following statement to learn about our practises for gathering and disseminating information.</p>

                We collect and store your personal information that you provide to us from time to time when you use our website. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you with a safe, efficient, smooth, and hassle-free experience that is personalised. This also allows us to provide services and features that are likely to meet your requirements, as well as customise our website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, we collect personal information from you that we believe is necessary for this purpose.
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">In general, you can browse the Website without revealing your identity or any personal information about yourself. You are no longer anonymous to us once you provide us with your personal information. Most of the time, we highlight which fields are required and which are optional. You can always choose not to provide information by not using a particular service or feature on the Website. Based on your behaviour on our website, we may automatically track certain information about you.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">We use this information to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour in order to better understand, protect, and serve our users. This data is aggregated and analysed. This information may include the URL you just came from (whether it is on our Website or not), the URL you go to next (whether it is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.</p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">On certain pages of the Website, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" to help analyse web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files that are placed on your hard drive to help us provide our services. We provide certain features that are only available by using a "cookie."
            </p>

            <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">We also use cookies to reduce the number of times you have to enter your password during a session. Cookies can also assist us in providing information tailored to your specific interests. The majority of cookies are "session cookies," which means they are deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. If your browser allows, you can always decline our cookies; however, you may be unable to use certain features of the Website and may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session as a result.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices placed by third parties on specific pages of the Website. We have no control over third-party cookie usage.</p>

                <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">We will collect the information you provide to us if you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms, or other message areas, or if you leave feedback. As permitted by law, we retain this information as long as it is required to resolve disputes, provide customer support, and troubleshoot problems.</p>
                <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">We may compile information about you into a file if you send us personal correspondence, including emails or letters, or if other users or other parties send us correspondence regarding your actions or postings on the Website.</p>

                <p class="my-1 py-1" style="text-align: justify;">When you create a free account with us, we collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment instrument details, and so on).
